 Biology
 Biology is the scientific study of life and living organisms. It is a broad natural science that encompasses a wide range of fields and
 unifying principles that explain the structure, function, growth, origin, evolution, and distribution of life. Central to biology are five
 fundamental themes: the cell as the basic unit of life, genes and heredity as the basis of inheritance, evolution as the driver of biological
 diversity, energy transformation for sustaining life processes, and the maintenance of internal stability (homeostasis).[1][2]
 Biology examines life across multiple levels of organization, from molecules and cells to organisms, populations, and ecosystems.
 Subdisciplines include molecular biology, physiology, ecology, evolutionary biology, developmental biology, and systematics, among
 others. Each of these fields applies a range of methods to investigate biological phenomena, including observation, experimentation, and
 mathematical modeling. Modern biology is grounded in the theory of evolution by natural selection, first articulated by Charles Darwin,
 and in the molecular understanding of genes encoded in DNA. The discovery of the structure of DNA and advances in molecular genetics
 have transformed many areas of biology, leading to applications in medicine, agriculture, biotechnology, and environmental science.
 Life on Earth is believed to have originated over 3.7 billion years ago.[3] Today, it includes a vast diversity of organisms—from single
celled archaea and bacteria to complex multicellular plants, fungi, and animals. Biologists classify organisms based on shared
 characteristics and evolutionary relationships, using taxonomic and phylogenetic frameworks. These organisms interact with each other
 and with their environments in ecosystems, where they play roles in energy flow and nutrient cycling. As a constantly evolving field,
 biology incorporates new discoveries and technologies that enhance the understanding of life and its processes, while contributing to
 solutions for challenges such as disease, climate change, and biodiversity loss.
 From Greek bios, life, (from Proto-Indo-European root *gwei-, to live) and logy, study of. The compound was coined in 1800 by Karl
 Friedrich Burdach and in 1802 used by both German naturalist Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck.[4]
 The earliest of roots of science, which included medicine, can be traced to ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3000 to 1200
 BCE.[5][6] Their contributions shaped ancient Greek natural philosophy.[7][5][6][8][9] Ancient Greek philosophers such as Aristotle (384
322 BCE) contributed extensively to the development of biological knowledge.[10] He explored biological causation and the diversity of
 life. His successor, Theophrastus, began the scientific study of plants.[11] Scholars of the medieval Islamic world who wrote on biology
 included al-Jahiz (781–869), Al-Dīnawarī (828–896), who wrote on botany,[12] and Rhazes (865–925) who wrote on anatomy and
 physiology. Medicine was especially well studied by Islamic scholars working in Greek philosopher traditions, while natural history drew
 heavily on Aristotelian thought.
 Etymology
 History
Drawing of what now are called Schwann
 cells by one of the founders of cell theory,
 Theodor Schwann.
 In 1842, Charles Darwin
 penned his first sketch of On
 the Origin of Species.[18]
 Biology began to quickly develop with Anton van Leeuwenhoek's dramatic improvement of
 the microscope. It was then that scholars discovered spermatozoa, bacteria, infusoria and the
 diversity of microscopic life. Investigations by Jan Swammerdam led to new interest in
 entomology and helped to develop techniques of microscopic dissection and staining.[13]
 Advances in microscopy had a profound impact on biological thinking. In the early 19th
 century, biologists pointed to the central importance of the cell. In 1838, Schleiden and
 Schwann began promoting the now universal ideas that (1) the basic unit of organisms is the
 cell and (2) that individual cells have all the characteristics of life, although they opposed the
 idea that (3) all cells come from the division of other cells, continuing to support spontaneous
 generation. However, Robert Remak and Rudolf Virchow were able to reify the third tenet, and
 by the 1860s most biologists accepted all three tenets which consolidated into cell
 theory.[14][15]
 Meanwhile, taxonomy and classification became the focus of natural historians. Carl Linnaeus
 published a basic taxonomy for the natural world in 1735, and in the 1750s introduced
 scientific names for all his species.[16] Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, treated
 species as artificial categories and living forms as malleable—even suggesting the possibility
 of common descent.[17]
 Serious evolutionary thinking originated with the works of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, who
 presented a coherent theory of evolution.[19] The British naturalist Charles Darwin, combining
 the biogeographical approach of Humboldt, the uniformitarian geology of Lyell, Malthus's writings on
 population growth, and his own morphological expertise and extensive natural observations, forged a
 more successful evolutionary theory based on natural selection; similar reasoning and evidence led
 Alfred Russel Wallace to independently reach the same conclusions.[20][21]
 The basis for modern genetics began with the work of Gregor Mendel in 1865.[22] This outlined the
 principles of biological inheritance.[23] However, the significance of his work was not realized until the
 early 20th century when evolution became a unified theory as the modern synthesis reconciled
 Darwinian evolution with classical genetics.[24] In the 1940s and early 1950s, a series of experiments by
 Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase pointed to DNA as the component of chromosomes that held the
 trait-carrying units that had become known as genes. A focus on new kinds of model organisms such as
 viruses and bacteria, along with the discovery of the double-helical structure of DNA by James Watson
 and Francis Crick in 1953, marked the transition to the era of molecular genetics. From the 1950s
 onwards, biology has been vastly extended in the molecular domain. The genetic code was cracked by
 Har Gobind Khorana, Robert W. Holley and Marshall Warren Nirenberg after DNA was understood to
 contain codons. The Human Genome Project was launched in 1990 to map the human genome.[25]
 All organisms are made up of chemical elements;[26] oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen account for most (96%) of the mass of all
 organisms, with calcium, phosphorus, sulfur, sodium, chlorine, and magnesium constituting essentially all the remainder. Different
 elements can combine to form compounds such as water, which is fundamental to life.[26] Biochemistry is the study of chemical processes
 within and relating to living organisms. Molecular biology is the branch of biology that seeks to understand the molecular basis of
 biological activity in and between cells, including molecular synthesis, modification, mechanisms, and interactions.
 Life arose from the Earth's first ocean, which formed some 3.8 billion years ago.[27] Since then, water continues to be the most abundant
 molecule in every organism. Water is important to life because it is an effective solvent, capable of dissolving solutes such as sodium and
 chloride ions or other small molecules to form an aqueous solution. Once dissolved in water, these solutes are more likely to come in
 contact with one another and therefore take part in chemical reactions that sustain life.[27] In terms of its molecular structure, water is a
 small polar molecule with a bent shape formed by the polar covalent bonds of two hydrogen (H) atoms to one oxygen (O) atom (H2O).[27]
 Because the O–H bonds are polar, the oxygen atom has a slight negative charge and the two hydrogen atoms have a slight positive
 charge.[27] This polar property of water allows it to attract other water molecules via hydrogen bonds, which makes water cohesive.[27]
 Surface tension results from the cohesive force due to the attraction between molecules at the surface of the liquid.[27] Water is also
 adhesive as it is able to adhere to the surface of any polar or charged non-water molecules.[27] Water is denser as a liquid than it is as a
 solid (or ice).[27] This unique property of water allows ice to float above liquid water such as ponds, lakes, and oceans, thereby insulating

 the liquid below from the cold air above.[27] Water has the capacity to absorb energy, giving it a higher
 specific heat capacity than other solvents such as ethanol.[27] Thus, a large amount of energy is needed
 to break the hydrogen bonds between water molecules to convert liquid water into water vapor.[27] As a
 molecule, water is not completely stable as each water molecule continuously dissociates into hydrogen
 and hydroxyl ions before reforming into a water molecule again.[27] In pure water, the number of
 hydrogen ions balances (or equals) the number of hydroxyl ions, resulting in a pH that is neutral.
 Organic compounds are molecules that contain carbon bonded to another element such as hydrogen.[27]
 With the exception of water, nearly all the molecules that make up each organism contain carbon.[27][28]
 Carbon can form covalent bonds with up to four other atoms, enabling it to form diverse, large, and
 complex molecules.[27][28] For example, a single carbon atom can form four single covalent bonds such
 as in methane, two double covalent bonds such as in carbon dioxide (CO2), or a triple covalent bond such as in
 carbon monoxide (CO). Moreover, carbon can form very long chains of interconnecting carbon–carbon bonds
 such as octane or ring-like structures such as glucose.
 The simplest form of an organic molecule is the hydrocarbon, which is a large family of organic compounds that
 are composed of hydrogen atoms bonded to a chain of carbon atoms. A hydrocarbon backbone can be substituted
 by other elements such as oxygen (O), hydrogen (H), phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S), which can change the
 chemical behavior of that compound.[27] Groups of atoms that contain these elements (O-, H-, P-, and S-) and are
 bonded to a central carbon atom or skeleton are called functional groups.[27] There are six prominent functional
 groups that can be found in organisms: amino group, carboxyl group, carbonyl group, hydroxyl group, phosphate
 group, and sulfhydryl group.[27]
 In 1953, the Miller–Urey experiment showed that organic compounds could be synthesized abiotically within a closed system mimicking
 the conditions of early Earth, thus suggesting that complex organic molecules could have arisen spontaneously in early Earth (see
 abiogenesis).[29][27]
 Macromolecules are large molecules made up of smaller subunits or
 monomers.[30] Monomers include sugars, amino acids, and nucleotides.[31]
 Carbohydrates include monomers and polymers of sugars.[32] Lipids are the only
 class of macromolecules that are not made up of polymers. They include steroids,
 phospholipids, and fats,[31] largely nonpolar and hydrophobic (water-repelling)
 substances.[33] Proteins are the most diverse of the macromolecules. They include
 enzymes, transport proteins, large signaling molecules, antibodies, and structural
 proteins. The basic unit (or monomer) of a protein is an amino acid.[30] Twenty
 amino acids are used in proteins.[30] Nucleic acids are polymers of nucleotides.[34]
 Their function is to store, transmit, and express hereditary information.[31]
 Cell theory states that cells are the fundamental units of life, that all living things
 are composed of one or more cells, and that all cells arise from preexisting cells
 through cell division.[35] Most cells are very small, with diameters ranging from 1
 to 100 micrometers and are therefore only visible under a light or electron microscope.[36] There are generally two types of cells:
 eukaryotic cells, which contain a nucleus, and prokaryotic cells, which do not. Prokaryotes are single-celled organisms such as bacteria,
 whereas eukaryotes can be single-celled or multicellular. In multicellular organisms, every cell in the organism's body is derived
 ultimately from a single cell in a fertilized egg.
 Every cell is enclosed within a cell membrane that separates its cytoplasm from the extracellular space.[37] A cell membrane consists of a
 lipid bilayer, including cholesterols that sit between phospholipids to maintain their fluidity at various temperatures. Cell membranes are
 semipermeable, allowing small molecules such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water to pass through while restricting the movement of
 larger molecules and charged particles such as ions.[38] Cell membranes also contain membrane proteins, including integral membrane
 proteins that go across the membrane serving as membrane transporters, and peripheral proteins that loosely attach to the outer side of the

 Metabolism
 All cells require energy to sustain cellular processes. 
Metabolism is the set of 
chemical
 reactions in an organism. The three main purposes of metabolism are: the conversion of food
 to energy to run cellular processes; the conversion of food/fuel to monomer building blocks;
 and the elimination of 
metabolic wastes. These enzyme-catalyzed reactions allow organisms to
 grow and reproduce, maintain their structures, and respond to their environments. Metabolic
 reactions may be categorized as 
catabolic—the breaking down of compounds (for example, the
 breaking down of glucose to pyruvate by 
cellular respiration); or 
anabolic—the building up
 (synthesis) of compounds (such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids). Usually,
 catabolism releases energy, and anabolism consumes energy. The chemical reactions of
 metabolism are organized into 
metabolic pathways, in which one chemical is transformed
 through a series of steps into another chemical, each step being facilitated by a specific
 enzyme. Enzymes are crucial to metabolism because they allow organisms to drive desirable
 reactions that require energy that will not occur by themselves, by 
coupling them to
 spontaneous reactions that release energy. Enzymes act as

 catalysts—they allow a reaction to proceed more rapidly without being
 consumed by it—by reducing the amount of 
activation energy needed to convert 
reactants into 
products. Enzymes also allow the
 regulation of the rate of a metabolic reaction, for example in response to changes in the cell's environment or to signals from other cells.

 catabolic reactions, which
 break large molecules into smaller ones, releasing energy. Respiration is one of the key ways a cell releases chemical energy to fuel
 cellular activity. The overall reaction occurs in a series of biochemical steps, some of which are 
redox reactions. Although cellular
 respiration is technically a 
combustion reaction, it clearly does not resemble one when it occurs in a cell because of the slow, controlled
 release of energy from the series of reactions.
 Sugar in the form of glucose is the main nutrient used by animal and plant cells in respiration. Cellular respiration involving oxygen is
 called aerobic respiration, which has four stages: 
glycolysis, 
citric acid cycle (or Krebs cycle), 
electron transport chain, and 
phosphorylation.
 [43] Glycolysis is a metabolic process that occurs in the cytoplasm whereby glucose is converted into two 
oxidative
 pyruvates, with
 two net molecules of ATP being produced at the same time.
 [43] Each pyruvate is then oxidized into 
dehydrogenase complex, which also generates 
acetyl-CoA by the 
pyruvate
 NADH and carbon dioxide. Acetyl-CoA enters the citric acid cycle, which takes places
 inside the mitochondrial matrix. At the end of the cycle, the total yield from 1 glucose (or 2 pyruvates) is 6 NADH, 2 FADH2, and 2 ATP
 molecules. Finally, the next stage is oxidative phosphorylation, which in eukaryotes, occurs in the 
mitochondrial cristae. Oxidative
phosphorylation comprises the electron transport chain, which is a
 series of four 
protein complexes that transfer electrons from one
 complex to another, thereby releasing energy from NADH and FADH2
 that is coupled to the pumping of protons (hydrogen ions) across the
 inner mitochondrial membrane (

 being the final 
electron acceptor.

 waste products that may be
 removed from the cell. This serves the purpose of oxidizing the
 electron carriers so that they can perform glycolysis again and
 removing the excess pyruvate. Fermentation oxidizes NADH to NAD+
 so it can be re-used in glycolysis. In the absence of oxygen, fermentation prevents the buildup of NADH in the cytoplasm and provides
 NAD+ for glycolysis. This waste product varies depending on the organism. In skeletal muscles, the waste product is

lactic acid. This type
 lactic acid fermentation. In strenuous exercise, when energy demands exceed energy supply, the respiratory chain
 cannot process all of the hydrogen atoms joined by NADH. During anaerobic glycolysis, NAD+ regenerates when pairs of hydrogen
 combine with pyruvate to form lactate. Lactate formation is catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase in a reversible reaction. Lactate can also
 be used as an indirect precursor for liver glycogen. During recovery, when oxygen becomes available, NAD+ attaches to hydrogen from
 lactate to form ATP. In yeast, the waste products are ethanol and carbon dioxide. This type of fermentation is known as alcoholic or
 ethanol fermentation. The ATP generated in this process is made by 
substrate-level phosphorylation, which does not require oxygen.
 Photosynthesis
 Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to

 that can later be released to fuel the organism's metabolic activities via cellular respiration. This chemical
 energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and
 water.
 [46] In most cases, oxygen is released as a waste product. Most plants,

 perform photosynthesis, which is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the 
Earth's atmosphere, and supplies most of the energy necessary for life on Earth.

 Light absorption is the initial step of photosynthesis whereby light energy is absorbed by

 attached to proteins in the 
thylakoid membranes. The absorbed light energy is used to remove electrons from a
 donor (water) to a primary electron acceptor, a 
quinone designated as Q. In the second stage, electrons move
 from the quinone primary electron acceptor through a series of electron carriers until they reach a final
 electron acceptor, which is usually the oxidized form of NADP+, which is reduced to NADPH, a process that
 takes place in a protein complex called 
photosystem I (PSI). The transport of electrons is coupled to the
 movement of protons (or hydrogen) from the stroma to the thylakoid membrane, which forms a pH gradient
 across the membrane as hydrogen becomes more concentrated in the lumen than in the stroma. This is
 analogous to the proton-motive force generated across the inner mitochondrial membrane in aerobic respiration.
 Photosynthesis changes
 sunlight into chemical
 energy, splits water to
 liberate O2, and fixes
 CO2 into sugar.
 [43]
 During the third stage of photosynthesis, the movement of protons down their 
concentration gradients from the thylakoid lumen to the
 stroma through the ATP synthase is coupled to the synthesis of ATP by that same ATP synthase.
 [43] The NADPH and ATPs generated by
 the 
light-dependent reactions in the second and third stages, respectively, provide the energy and electrons to drive the synthesis of glucose
 by fixing atmospheric carbon dioxide into existing organic carbon compounds, such as 
ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) in a sequence of

 juxtacrine signaling, there is direct contact between the signaling and responding cells. Finally, hormones are ligands that travel through
 the circulatory systems of animals or vascular systems of plants to reach their target cells. Once a ligand binds with a receptor, it can
 influence the behavior of another cell, depending on the type of receptor. For instance, neurotransmitters that bind with an inotropic
 receptor can alter the excitability of a target cell. Other types of receptors include protein kinase receptors (e.g., receptor for the hormone
 insulin) and G protein-coupled receptors. Activation of G protein-coupled receptors can initiate second messenger cascades. The process
 by which a chemical or physical signal is transmitted through a cell as a series of molecular events is called signal transduction.
 The cell cycle is a series of events that take place in a cell that cause it to divide into two daughter cells. These events include the
 duplication of its DNA and some of its organelles, and the subsequent partitioning of its cytoplasm into two daughter cells in a process
 called cell division.[52] In eukaryotes (i.e., animal, plant, fungal, and protist cells), there are two distinct types of cell division: mitosis and
 meiosis.[53] Mitosis is part of the cell cycle, in which replicated chromosomes are separated into two new nuclei. Cell division gives rise to
 genetically identical cells in which the total number of chromosomes is maintained. In general, mitosis (division of the nucleus) is
 preceded by the S stage of interphase (during which the DNA is replicated) and is often followed by telophase and cytokinesis; which
 divides the cytoplasm, organelles and cell membrane of one cell into two new cells containing roughly equal shares of these cellular
 components. The different stages of mitosis all together define the mitotic phase of an animal cell cycle—the division of the mother cell
 into two genetically identical daughter cells.[54] The cell cycle is a vital process by which a single-celled fertilized egg develops into a
 mature organism, as well as the process by which hair, skin, blood cells, and some internal organs are renewed. After cell division, each of
 the daughter cells begin the interphase of a new cycle. In contrast to mitosis, meiosis results in four haploid daughter cells by undergoing
 one round of DNA replication followed by two divisions.[55] Homologous chromosomes are separated in the first division (meiosis I), and
 sister chromatids are separated in the second division (meiosis II). Both of these cell division cycles are used in the process of sexual
 reproduction at some point in their life cycle. Both are believed to be present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor.
 Prokaryotes (i.e., archaea and bacteria) can also undergo cell division (or binary fission). Unlike the
 processes of mitosis and meiosis in eukaryotes, binary fission in prokaryotes takes place without the
 formation of a spindle apparatus on the cell. Before binary fission, DNA in the bacterium is tightly
 coiled. After it has uncoiled and duplicated, it is pulled to the separate poles of the bacterium as it
 increases the size to prepare for splitting. Growth of a new cell wall begins to separate the bacterium
 (triggered by FtsZ polymerization and "Z-ring" formation).[56] The new cell wall (septum) fully
 develops, resulting in the complete split of the bacterium. The new daughter cells have tightly coiled
 DNA rods, ribosomes, and plasmids.
 Meiosis is a central feature of sexual reproduction in eukaryotes, and the most fundamental function of
 meiosis appears to be conservation of the integrity of the genome that is passed on to progeny by
 parents.[57][58] Two aspects of sexual reproduction, meiotic recombination and outcrossing, are likely
 maintained respectively by the adaptive advantages of recombinational repair of genomic DNA
 damage and genetic complementation which masks the expression of deleterious recessive mutations.[59]
 The beneficial effect of genetic complementation, derived from outcrossing (cross-fertilization) is also referred to as hybrid vigor or
 heterosis. Charles Darwin in his 1878 book The Effects of Cross and Self-Fertilization in the Vegetable Kingdom[60] at the start of chapter
 XII noted “The first and most important of the conclusions which may be drawn from the observations given in this volume, is that
 generally cross-fertilisation is beneficial and self-fertilisation often injurious, at least with the plants on which I experimented.” Genetic
 variation, often produced as a byproduct of sexual reproduction, may provide long-term advantages to those sexual lineages that engage in
 outcrossing.[59]

 The extended central dogma of molecular biology
 includes all the processes involved in the flow of
 genetic information.
 Genetics is the scientific study of inheritance.[61][62][63] Mendelian inheritance, specifically, is the process by
 which genes and traits are passed on from parents to offspring.[23] It has several principles. The first is that
 genetic characteristics, alleles, are discrete and have alternate forms (e.g., purple vs. white or tall vs. dwarf),
 each inherited from one of two parents. Based on the law of dominance and uniformity, which states that some
 alleles are dominant while others are recessive; an organism with at least one dominant allele will display the
 phenotype of that dominant allele. During gamete formation, the alleles for each gene segregate, so that each
 gamete carries only one allele for each gene. Heterozygotic individuals produce gametes with an equal
 frequency of two alleles. Finally, the law of independent assortment, states that genes of different traits can
 segregate independently during the formation of gametes, i.e., genes are unlinked. An exception to this rule
 would include traits that are sex-linked. Test crosses can be performed to experimentally determine the
 underlying genotype of an organism with a dominant phenotype.[64] A Punnett square can be used to predict
 the results of a test cross. The chromosome theory of inheritance, which states that genes are found on
 chromosomes, was supported by Thomas Morgans's experiments with fruit flies, which established the sex
 linkage between eye color and sex in these insects.[65]
 A gene is a unit of heredity that corresponds to a region of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that carries
 genetic information that controls form or function of an organism. DNA is composed of two
 polynucleotide chains that coil around each other to form a double helix.[66] It is found as linear
 chromosomes in eukaryotes, and circular chromosomes in prokaryotes. The set of chromosomes in a cell
 is collectively known as its genome. In eukaryotes, DNA is mainly in the cell nucleus.[67] In prokaryotes,
 the DNA is held within the nucleoid.[68] The genetic information is held within genes, and the complete
 assemblage in an organism is called its genotype.[69] DNA replication is a semiconservative process
 whereby each strand serves as a template for a new strand of DNA.[66] Mutations are heritable changes in
 DNA.[66] They can arise spontaneously as a result of replication errors that were not corrected by
 proofreading or can be induced by an environmental mutagen such as a chemical (e.g., nitrous acid,
 benzopyrene) or radiation (e.g., x-ray, gamma ray, ultraviolet radiation, particles emitted by unstable
 isotopes).[66] Mutations can lead to phenotypic effects such as loss-of-function, gain-of-function, and
 conditional mutations.[66] Some mutations are beneficial, as they are a source of genetic variation for
 evolution.[66] Others are harmful if they were to result in a loss of function of genes needed for
 survival.[66]
 Gene expression is the molecular process by which a genotype encoded in DNA gives
 rise to an observable phenotype in the proteins of an organism's body. This process is
 summarized by the central dogma of molecular biology, which was formulated by
 Francis Crick in 1958.[70][71][72] According to the Central Dogma, genetic information
 flows from DNA to RNA to protein. There are two gene expression processes:
 transcription (DNA to RNA) and translation (RNA to protein).[73]
 The regulation of gene expression by environmental factors and during different stages
 of development can occur at each step of the process such as transcription, RNA
 splicing, translation, and post-translational modification of a protein.[74] Gene
 expression can be influenced by positive or negative regulation, depending on which of
 the two types of regulatory proteins called transcription factors bind to the DNA sequence close to or at a promoter.[74] A cluster of genes
 that share the same promoter is called an operon, found mainly in prokaryotes and some lower eukaryotes (e.g., Caenorhabditis
 elegans).[74][75] In positive regulation of gene expression, the activator is the transcription factor that stimulates transcription when it binds
 to the sequence near or at the promoter. Negative regulation occurs when another transcription factor called a repressor binds to a DNA
 sequence called an operator, which is part of an operon, to prevent transcription. Repressors can be inhibited by compounds called
 inducers (e.g., allolactose), thereby allowing transcription to occur.[74] Specific genes that can be activated by inducers are called inducible

 genes, in contrast to constitutive genes that are almost constantly active.[74] In contrast to both, structural genes encode proteins that are
 not involved in gene regulation.[74] In addition to regulatory events involving the promoter, gene expression can also be regulated by
 epigenetic changes to chromatin, which is a complex of DNA and protein found in eukaryotic cells.[74]
 Development is the process by which a multicellular organism (plant or animal) goes through a series of changes, starting from a single
 cell, and taking on various forms that are characteristic of its life cycle.[76] There are four key processes that underlie development:
 Determination, differentiation, morphogenesis, and growth. Determination sets the developmental fate of a cell, which becomes more
 restrictive during development. Differentiation is the process by which specialized cells arise from less specialized cells such as stem
 cells.[77][78] Stem cells are undifferentiated or partially differentiated cells that can differentiate into various types of cells and proliferate
 indefinitely to produce more of the same stem cell.[79] Cellular differentiation dramatically changes a cell's size, shape, membrane
 potential, metabolic activity, and responsiveness to signals, which are largely due to highly controlled modifications in gene expression
 and epigenetics. With a few exceptions, cellular differentiation almost never involves a change in the DNA sequence itself.[80] Thus,
 different cells can have very different physical characteristics despite having the same genome. Morphogenesis, or the development of
 body form, is the result of spatial differences in gene expression.[76] A small fraction of the genes in an organism's genome called the
 developmental-genetic toolkit control the development of that organism. These toolkit genes are highly conserved among phyla, meaning
 that they are ancient and very similar in widely separated groups of animals. Differences in deployment of toolkit genes affect the body
 plan and the number, identity, and pattern of body parts. Among the most important toolkit genes are the Hox genes. Hox genes determine
 where repeating parts, such as the many vertebrae of snakes, will grow in a developing embryo or larva.[81]
 Evolution is a central organizing concept in biology. It is the change in heritable characteristics of populations
 over successive generations.[82][83] In artificial selection, animals were selectively bred for specific traits. [84]
 Given that traits are inherited, populations contain a varied mix of traits, and reproduction is able to increase
 any population, Darwin argued that in the natural world, it was nature that played the role of humans in
 selecting for specific traits.[84] Darwin inferred that individuals who possessed heritable traits better adapted to
 their environments are more likely to survive and produce more offspring than other individuals.[84] He
 further inferred that this would lead to the accumulation of favorable traits over successive generations,
 thereby increasing the match between the organisms and their environment.[85][86][87][84][88]
 A species is a group of organisms that mate with one another and speciation is the process by which one lineage splits into two lineages as
 a result of having evolved independently from each other.[89] For speciation to occur, there has to be reproductive isolation.[89]
 Reproductive isolation can result from incompatibilities between genes as described by Bateson–Dobzhansky–Muller model.
 Reproductive isolation also tends to increase with genetic divergence. Speciation can occur when there are physical barriers that divide an
 ancestral species, a process known as allopatric speciation.[89]
 A phylogeny is an evolutionary history of a specific group of organisms or their
 genes.[90] It can be represented using a phylogenetic tree, a diagram showing lines of
 descent among organisms or their genes. Each line drawn on the time axis of a tree
 represents a lineage of descendants of a particular species or population. When a
 lineage divides into two, it is represented as a fork or split on the phylogenetic tree.[90]
 Phylogenetic trees are the basis for comparing and grouping different species.[90]
 Different species that share a feature inherited from a common ancestor are described
 as having homologous features (or synapomorphy).[91][92][90] Phylogeny provides the
 basis of biological classification.[90] This classification system is rank-based, with the
 highest rank being the domain followed by kingdom, phylum, class, order, family,
 genus, and species.[90] All organisms can be classified as belonging to one of three
 domains: Archaea (originally Archaebacteria), Bacteria (originally eubacteria), or
 Eukarya (includes the fungi, plant, and animal kingdoms).[93]

 The history of life on Earth traces how organisms have evolved from the earliest emergence of life to present day. Earth formed about 4.5
 billion years ago and all life on Earth, both living and extinct, descended from a last universal common ancestor that lived about 3.5
 billion years ago.[94][95] Geologists have developed a geologic time scale that divides the history of the Earth into major divisions, starting
 with four eons (Hadean, Archean, Proterozoic, and Phanerozoic), the first three of which are collectively known as the Precambrian, which
 lasted approximately 4 billion years.[96] Each eon can be divided into eras, with the Phanerozoic eon that began 539 million years ago[97]
 being subdivided into Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic eras.[96] These three eras together comprise eleven periods (Cambrian,
 Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, Permian, Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous, Tertiary, and Quaternary).[96]
 The similarities among all known present-day species indicate that they have diverged through the process of evolution from their
 common ancestor.[98] Biologists regard the ubiquity of the genetic code as evidence of universal common descent for all bacteria, archaea,
 and eukaryotes.[99][3][100][101] Microbial mats of coexisting bacteria and archaea were the dominant form of life in the early Archean eon
 and many of the major steps in early evolution are thought to have taken place in this environment.[102] The earliest evidence of
 eukaryotes dates from 1.85 billion years ago,[103][104] and while they may have been present earlier, their diversification accelerated when
 they started using oxygen in their metabolism. Later, around 1.7 billion years ago, multicellular organisms began to appear, with
 differentiated cells performing specialised functions.[105]
 Algae-like multicellular land plants are dated back to about 1 billion years ago,[106] although evidence suggests that microorganisms
 formed the earliest terrestrial ecosystems, at least 2.7 billion years ago.[107] Microorganisms are thought to have paved the way for the
 inception of land plants in the Ordovician period. Land plants were so successful that they are thought to have contributed to the Late
 Devonian extinction event.[108]
 Ediacara biota appear during the Ediacaran period,[109] while vertebrates, along with most other modern phyla originated about 525
 million years ago during the Cambrian explosion.[110] During the Permian period, synapsids, including the ancestors of mammals,
 dominated the land,[111] but most of this group became extinct in the Permian–Triassic extinction event 252 million years ago.[112] During
 the recovery from this catastrophe, archosaurs became the most abundant land vertebrates;[113] one archosaur group, the dinosaurs,
 dominated the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.[114] After the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago killed off the
 non-avian dinosaurs,[115] mammals increased rapidly in size and diversity.[116] Such mass extinctions may have accelerated evolution by
 providing opportunities for new groups of organisms to diversify.[117]
 Bacteria are a type of cell that constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms. Typically a
 few micrometers in length, bacteria have a number of shapes, ranging from spheres to rods and
 spirals. Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on Earth, and are present in most of its
 habitats. Bacteria inhabit soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste,[118] and the deep
 biosphere of the Earth's crust. Bacteria also live in symbiotic and parasitic relationships with plants
 and animals. Most bacteria have not been characterised, and only about 27 percent of the bacterial
 phyla have species that can be grown in the laboratory.[119]
 Archaea constitute the other domain of prokaryotic cells and were initially classified as bacteria,
 receiving the name archaebacteria (in the Archaebacteria kingdom), a term that has fallen out of
 use.[120] Archaeal cells have unique properties separating them from the other two domains, Bacteria
 and Eukaryota. Archaea are further divided into multiple recognized phyla. Archaea and bacteria are
 generally similar in size and shape, although a few archaea have very different shapes, such as the
 flat and square cells of Haloquadratum walsbyi.[121] Despite this morphological similarity to
 bacteria, archaea possess genes and several metabolic pathways that are more closely related to those
 of eukaryotes, notably for the enzymes involved in transcription and translation. Other aspects of
 archaeal biochemistry are unique, such as their reliance on ether lipids in their cell membranes,[122]
 including archaeols. Archaea use more energy sources than eukaryotes: these range from organic
 compounds, such as sugars, to ammonia, metal ions or even hydrogen gas. Salt-tolerant archaea (the
 Haloarchaea) use sunlight as an energy source, and other species of archaea fix carbon, but unlike
 plants and cyanobacteria, no known species of archaea does both. Archaea reproduce asexually by
 binary fission, fragmentation, or budding; unlike bacteria, no known species of Archaea form endospores.
 The first observed archaea were extremophiles, living in extreme environments, such as hot springs and salt lakes with no other organisms.
 Improved molecular detection tools led to the discovery of archaea in almost every habitat, including soil, oceans, and marshlands.
 Archaea are particularly numerous in the oceans, and the archaea in plankton may be one of the most abundant groups of organisms on the

 Archaea are a major part of Earth's life. They are part of the microbiota of all organisms. In the human microbiome, they are important in
 the gut, mouth, and on the skin.[123] Their morphological, metabolic, and geographical diversity permits them to play multiple ecological
 roles: carbon fixation; nitrogen cycling; organic compound turnover; and maintaining microbial symbiotic and syntrophic communities,
 for example.[124]
 Eukaryotes are hypothesized to have split from archaea, which was followed by their
 endosymbioses with bacteria (or symbiogenesis) that gave rise to mitochondria and
 chloroplasts, both of which are now part of modern-day eukaryotic cells.[125] The major
 lineages of eukaryotes diversified in the Precambrian about 1.5 billion years ago and can be
 classified into eight major clades: alveolates, excavates, stramenopiles, plants, rhizarians,
 amoebozoans, fungi, and animals.[125] Five of these clades are collectively known as protists,
 which are mostly microscopic eukaryotic organisms that are not plants, fungi, or animals.[125]
 While it is likely that protists share a common ancestor (the last eukaryotic common
 ancestor),[126] protists by themselves do not constitute a separate clade as some protists may be
 more closely related to plants, fungi, or animals than they are to other protists. Like groupings
 such as algae, invertebrates, or protozoans, the protist grouping is not a formal taxonomic
 group but is used for convenience.[125][127] Most protists are unicellular; these are called
 microbial eukaryotes.[125]
 Plants are mainly multicellular organisms, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae, which would exclude fungi
 and some algae. Plant cells were derived by endosymbiosis of a cyanobacterium into an early eukaryote about one billion years ago, which
 gave rise to chloroplasts.[128] The first several clades that emerged following primary endosymbiosis were aquatic and most of the aquatic
 photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms are collectively described as algae, which is a term of convenience as not all algae are closely
 related.[128] Algae comprise several distinct clades such as glaucophytes, which are microscopic freshwater algae that may have resembled
 in form to the early unicellular ancestor of Plantae.[128] Unlike glaucophytes, the other algal clades such as red and green algae are
 multicellular. Green algae comprise three major clades: chlorophytes, coleochaetophytes, and stoneworts.[128]
 Fungi are eukaryotes that digest foods outside their bodies,[129] secreting digestive enzymes that break down large food molecules before
 absorbing them through their cell membranes. Many fungi are also saprobes, feeding on dead organic matter, making them important
 decomposers in ecological systems.[129]
 Animals are multicellular eukaryotes. With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, can
 reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Over 1.5 million living animal
 species have been described—of which around 1 million are insects—but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in
 total. They have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs.[130]
 Viruses are submicroscopic infectious agents that replicate inside the cells of organisms.[131] Viruses
 infect all types of life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and
 archaea.[132][133] More than 6,000 virus species have been described in detail.[134] Viruses are found in
 almost every ecosystem on Earth and are the most numerous type of biological entity.[135][136]
 The origins of viruses in the evolutionary history of life are unclear: some may have evolved from
 plasmids—pieces of DNA that can move between cells—while others may have evolved from bacteria.
 In evolution, viruses are an important means of horizontal gene transfer, which increases genetic
 diversity in a way analogous to sexual reproduction.[137] Because viruses possess some but not all
 characteristics of life, they have been described as "organisms at the edge of life",[138] and as self
replicators.[139]
 Ecology is the study of the distribution and abundance of life, the interaction between organisms and their environment.[140]

 A (a) trophic pyramid and a (b) simplified food
 web. The trophic pyramid represents the
 biomass at each level.[152]
 The community of living (biotic) organisms in conjunction with the nonliving (abiotic) components (e.g., water, light, radiation,
 temperature, humidity, atmosphere, acidity, and soil) of their environment is called an ecosystem.[141][142][143] These biotic and abiotic
 components are linked together through nutrient cycles and energy flows.[144] Energy from the sun enters the system through
 photosynthesis and is incorporated into plant tissue. By feeding on plants and on one another, animals move matter and energy through the
 system. They also influence the quantity of plant and microbial biomass present. By breaking down dead organic matter, decomposers
 release carbon back to the atmosphere and facilitate nutrient cycling by converting nutrients stored in dead biomass back to a form that can
 be readily used by plants and other microbes.[145]
 A population is the group of organisms of the same species that occupies an area
 and reproduce from generation to generation.[146][147][148][149][150] Population
 size can be estimated by multiplying population density by the area or volume.
 The carrying capacity of an environment is the maximum population size of a
 species that can be sustained by that specific environment, given the food, habitat,
 water, and other resources that are available.[151] The carrying capacity of a
 population can be affected by changing environmental conditions such as changes
 in the availability of resources and the cost of maintaining them. In human
 populations, new technologies such as the Green revolution have helped increase
 the Earth's carrying capacity for humans over time, which has stymied the
 attempted predictions of impending population decline, the most famous of which
 was by Thomas Malthus in the 18th century.[146]
 A community is a group of populations of species occupying the same
 geographical area at the same time.[153] A biological interaction is the effect that a pair of
 organisms living together in a community have on each other. They can be either of the
 same species (intraspecific interactions), or of different species (interspecific interactions).
 These effects may be short-term, like pollination and predation, or long-term; both often
 strongly influence the evolution of the species involved. A long-term interaction is called
 a symbiosis. Symbioses range from mutualism, beneficial to both partners, to competition,
 harmful to both partners.[154] Every species participates as a consumer, resource, or both
 in consumer–resource interactions, which form the core of food chains or food webs.[155]
 There are different trophic levels within any food web, with the lowest level being the
 primary producers (or autotrophs) such as plants and algae that convert energy and
 inorganic material into organic compounds, which can then be used by the rest of the community.[47][156][157] At the next level are the
 heterotrophs, which are the species that obtain energy by breaking apart organic compounds from other organisms.[155] Heterotrophs that
 consume plants are primary consumers (or herbivores) whereas heterotrophs that consume herbivores are secondary consumers (or
 carnivores). And those that eat secondary consumers are tertiary consumers and so on. Omnivorous heterotrophs are able to consume at
 multiple levels. Finally, there are decomposers that feed on the waste products or dead bodies of organisms.[155] On average, the total
 amount of energy incorporated into the biomass of a trophic level per unit of time is about one-tenth of the energy of the trophic level that
 it consumes. Waste and dead material used by decomposers as well as heat lost from metabolism make up the other ninety percent of
 energy that is not consumed by the next trophic level.[158]
 In the global ecosystem or biosphere, matter exists as different interacting compartments, which can be biotic or abiotic as well as
 accessible or inaccessible, depending on their forms and locations.[160] For example, matter from terrestrial autotrophs are both biotic and
 accessible to other organisms whereas the matter in rocks and minerals are abiotic and inaccessible. A biogeochemical cycle is a pathway
 by which specific elements of matter are turned over or moved through the biotic (biosphere) and the abiotic (lithosphere, atmosphere, and
 hydrosphere) compartments of Earth. There are biogeochemical cycles for nitrogen, carbon, and water.
 Conservation biology is the study of the conservation of Earth's biodiversity with the aim of protecting species, their habitats, and
 ecosystems from excessive rates of extinction and the erosion of biotic interactions.[161][162][163] It is concerned with factors that influence
 the maintenance, loss, and restoration of biodiversity and the science of sustaining evolutionary processes that engender genetic,
 population, species, and ecosystem diversity.[164][165][166][167] The concern stems from estimates suggesting that up to 50% of all species
 on the planet will disappear within the next 50 years,[168] which has contributed to poverty, starvation, and will reset the course of

 ecosystems, which provide a variety of services upon which people depend.
 Conservation biologists research and educate on the trends of biodiversity loss,
 species extinctions, and the negative effect these are having on our capabilities to
 sustain the well-being of human society. Organizations and citizens are
 responding to the current biodiversity crisis through conservation action plans that
 direct research, monitoring, and education programs that engage concerns at local
 through global scales.[171][164][165][166]
